                            The overarching goal for Hapitapp is for parents and children to contribute to the overall goal of building resiliency.

                After deciding on our interview audience to be working parents with children in online school, 
                we conducted several interviews to identify their pain points. We asked a variety of questions
                regarding their personal lives, mental health, and work environments,
                but focused the most on their relationships with their children as they transitioned to an 
                online school environment. For example, we asked, "How do you feel about online learning?", 
                "What part of managing a child’s online learning is the most challenging?", and 
                "What part of the day tends to be the most stressful for you? What methods of stress management have 
                been very important for you?".</p>
            <p>
                User 1 explained the difficulty and stress of managing both of her young children while maintaining a 
                professional mindset for her ongoing work meetings. She is frequently interrupted by them, stating how, 
                "Every 30 min we had to do something which was very time consuming. One would have music, one would have 
                PE so grab a ball, etc. while the other needs music supplies. It was very hectic." Her children have needs 
                that she cannot ignore which constantly interrupts her work environment. 

                User 2 felt that their children's social development is being impacted negatively by virtual schooling, 
                and that negative impact has been felt by the user's children as well. "I feel [virtual school] can be
                 negative because of lack of social interaction". 

                 User 4 noted that her home life is much more chaotic now that her children are learning from home.
                  Though she views this time as an opportunity for her children to develop independence and responsibility 
                  (and thus does not try to actively manage or monitor them much), they have many distractions in their
                   home lives than they would at school. User 4 could benefit from a product that helps kids develop 
                   their self-regulation.

                From conducting these interviews we were then able to condense their main traits and pain points into personas.

                        Jacob, 37, is a single father and music teacher who values teaching his students and empowering them to pursue music. 
                        He homeschools his two young children at home. It’s important to him that his children 
                        spend time outdoors, and they do so after lunch. Jacob has noticed that his children have been less motivated to 
                        learn and do their homework he assigns them. He personally struggles with defining boundaries between when he is a father 
                        to them and can support them emotionally versus supporting them as their teacher in a more professional relationship. 
                        He finds himself constantly asking his children, “Would you say that to your actual teacher?” Jacob creates a goal for his 
                        children called, “Behaving in class.” He also creates a goal for himself called, “Separating school from home.” After he
                         inputs their goal, their ecosystem with a tree is spawned. After they have checked that they completed their goal for the
                          day, the virtual tree begins to grow. Jacob also has lots of housework now because of the pandemic—almost double—and he 
                          creates concrete goals, such as "Children make their own beds each morning" and "Clean the kitchen after dinner"
                          . He and his family work together to accomplish these goals, and each completed goal contributes to the collaborative "tree".

                        May, 8, recently started virtual school and feels frustrated by the lack of social interaction the virtual environment 
                        brings. She enjoys academics, but it's harder for her to concentrate when she has to sit in front of a screen. Her teacher 
                        has noticed her learning has slowed down online due to her diagnosed dyslexia. Her mother has also noticed this, and discussed 
                        setting goals with her. May says she wants to keep up with classes, which is difficult due to her dyslexia. Her and her mother 
                        make a goal for May called "Complete English homework on time". She completes this goal and checks it off in the evening after 
                        it's been completed. Once it's completed, her and her mother contribute the goal's "point" to the collaborative growth tree.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fiona, 46, is a married mother of two. While she feels that virtual school is a passable method of education, she's not 
                        thrilled by the lack of social interaction and reduced amount of personal involvement that virtual school brings. For her,
                         it's important that her children build the social skills and responsibility that in-person classes cultivate. She also has a 
                         busy work schedule due to her increased virtual work hours, and has the added stresses of keeping the house clean. To remedy this, she downloads our app and creates the goal "Make
                          time for after-school discussions", a goal she hopes to achieve so that she can become more involved in her childrens' 
                          academic lives. She checks off the goal at night once it's been completed, and contributes the goal's "point" to the 
                          collaborative growth tree.

                            <p>This prototype was created using Figma. After we laid out the basic structure of our app, we added important elements
                                such as color, icons, fonts, and illustrations to create a model that looked closer to our final goal. This prototype
                                is also interactive and demonstrates the main functions of our app.

                <h2 class="font-alt">Summary of Takeaways from Heuristic Evaluations</h2>
                <p>
                        From the heuristic evaluations that were performed on our app, we had a few key takeaways from the evaluators' suggestions. Overall, users
                        found the app structure to be streamlined and easy to navigate. However, evaluators also suggested that the app needed more customization,
                        such as giving the parents more freedom to choose different goals. Additionally, they noted that error recognition and recovery features
                        could be increased, as should accessibility features. These suggestions will be implemented in future iterations of Habitapp.
